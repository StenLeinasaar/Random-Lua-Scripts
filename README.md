# Random-Lua-Scripts
Testing Lua and practicing


# What is happening?

Well, I atemmpt, from time to time, to learn new skills. Lua seemed a perfect thing because it is lightweight, super adaptable, and just simple to learn. It comes with its own challenges, but it is fun to  start from 0 and just picking on it yourself. 

So I started to build a blackjack game from scratch. Just me and the documentation. Nothing else. 

I believe that best way to learn is to just get at it. Well, and also I need this scripting language for work once one project begins. So I was tasked to learn it. Here I am. 

And it is quite fun.
